This is a Snap package for the Device Tree Compiler (dtc).

Device Tree Compiler, dtc, takes as input a device-tree in a given format and outputs a device-tree in another format for booting kernels on embedded systems.  Typically, the input format is "dts", a human readable source format, and creates  a "dtb", or binary format as output.
